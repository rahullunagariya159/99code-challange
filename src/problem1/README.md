# Problem 1: Three ways to sum to n

This folder contains three different implementations to compute the sum from 1 to n.

## Files

- `sum_to_n.js` - Contains all three implementations
- `index.html` - Simple web page to test the functions

## Implementations

### 1. Iterative Approach
Uses a simple for loop. Time: O(n), Space: O(1)

### 2. Mathematical Formula
Uses the formula: n * (n + 1) / 2. Time: O(1), Space: O(1)

### 3. Recursive Approach
Uses recursion. Time: O(n), Space: O(n) due to call stack
